# entropix-annotated

* forked from [xjdr-alt/entropix](https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix)
![High Level Diagram](./images/entropix-diagram.png)

# goals of this fork

* make a more accessible entrypoint for people hearing about entropix
* annotate the code and document the 'why'
* annotate and document with an often 'skeptical' point of view, given the immense amount of hype that comes with every trend in the LLM space (note: this is healthy skepticism)
* drive more curiosity and ideas around parallel sampling and speculative decoding / draft models / tokenization tinkering
* showcase the power of base models vs. chat/instruct models
* create a starting point for others to continue

# contributing

* feel free to PR (or fork the fork) any additional comments/thoughts/tests that can be helpful
* the only new code should be tests of using the existing entropix code - this repo is *not* meant to act as a replacement code repo
