"Rational Human","In this task, you're given a paragraph that describes an event. You need to answer the question 'Is the text coherent?', where 'coherent' means all of the sentences in the text can be arranged in one order and still create a smooth reading experience without any abrupt changes or jumps. Your answer must be either Yes or No. If the answer is No, that means at least two sentences cannot be arranged to form a single cohesive story.\nText: Even though I was very tired, I didn't fall asleep right away. I tried counting sheep, but it didn't work. So instead, I got out of bed and decided to get something to drink."
